# My AWS-Projects
## Overview
Cloud Computing is the on-demand delivery of computing services especially servers, databases, data storage networking, computing power, and other IT resources via the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing; It is renting resources on another company's computers whereby you pay for only what you use, which serve as building blocks that will help you meet your business goals and satisfy technology requirements.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers many services in cloud computing and it is chosen by my clients based on flexible, reliable, scalable, easy-to-use, and cost-effective cloud computing solutions that include a mixture of infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and software as a service offering.

The repository consists of carefully crafted architectures that exemplify the prevailing best practices in the market. I have documented the configuration steps ensuring brevity and clarity.
To simplify the process of infrastructure provisioning, I will employ CloudFormation. This approach streamlines the deployment of infrastructure and allows for the creation of templates for desired AWS services and application architectures.

As an AWS Cloud Solutions Architect, I have developed a GitHub repository that showcases a range of projects successfully implemented in test and other environments. The primary objective of this repository is to demonstrate my expertise in working with AWS products and services and serve as a future reference for troubleshooting and implementation processes for myself and others in this specialization.
# NOTE
I mostly use the name **Lab** ( Lab VPC, Lab Subnet, Lab IGW, and so on) in all these Projects, you can do the same or choose a preferred name for your configurations.
